score.ajax

.. _js_ajax:

A small helper for managing AJAX requests.

Quickstart
==========

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="score.init.js"></script>
    <script src="score.ajax.js"></script>
    <script>
        score.ajax('/api/fruits').then(function(result) {
            for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
                console.log('Initiating self-defense against ' + result[i]);
            }
        });
    </script>

Details
=======

Return value
------------

The return value of this function depends on the `Content-Type`_ header of the
server response. You can find a good documentation of the
`XMLHttpRequest.response`_ types on MDN.

.. _Content-Type: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17
.. _XMLHttpRequest.response: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/response

Callback
--------

Internet explorer does not provide promises_, you will either have to use a
polyfill, or use the callback-based API of this module:

.. code-block:: javascript

    score.ajax.callback('/api/fruits', function(result) {
        for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
            console.log('Initiating self-defense against ' + result[i]);
        }
    }, function() {
        // this is the error callback
        alert('Could not load fruits, nothing to defend against!');
    });

If you are passing any options, you must provide them *before* the callback:

.. code-block:: javascript

    score.ajax.callback('/api/fruits', {headers: {'X-Spam': 'spam!'}}, function(result) {
        ...

.. _promises: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

Options
-------

You can pass an options object after the URL. The following keys are currently
supported:

* ``method``: An HTTP verb to use (i.e. "POST", "PUT", etc.) Defaults to "GET".
* ``headers``: An object mapping HTTP headers to values. These will be sent as
  part of the request. Note that you cannot set certain headers (you can find
  the `list of forbidden headers`_ on MDN). Also note, that it is also possible
  to perform `cross-domain AJAX requests`_, albeit with heavy restrictions.
